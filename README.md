Classification Model for Preventative Maintenance Prediction 

(Capstone Project for Machine Learning Accelerator Masterclass - see https://pro.elitedatascience.com/accelerator for course description)

In this project, we used a [labeled predictive maintenance dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/AI4I+2020+Predictive+Maintenance+Dataset "UCI Machine Learning Repository - AI4I Predictive Maintenance Dataset") obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to develop a classification model that predicts if a machine in the representative process has failed. Knowledge of machines failure/non-failure allows alerts the process owners to the need for a preventative maintenance event to minimize unexpected and unplanned process shut downs.
